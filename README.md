# image_allignment

- Feature-based image alignment using OpenCV
- we have two images of the same scene or the same document, but they are not aligned. In other words, if you pick a feature (say a corner)   on one image, the coordinates of the same corner in the other image is very different.
- Image alignment (also known as image registration) is the technique of warping one image ( or sometimes both images ) so that the           features in the two images line up perfectly.
